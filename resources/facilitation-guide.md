## 📝 Crafting Discussion Questions

### Question Types

**Opening Questions** (to get conversation started)
- "What was your first reaction to this?"
- "What's one thing that stood out to you?"
- "What surprised you in this material?"

**Analytical Questions** (to go deeper)
- "What assumptions is the author making?"
- "What tradeoffs are mentioned? What tradeoffs are missing?"
- "How does this compare to [related concept]?"

**Application Questions** (to connect to our work)
- "How might this apply to research software development?"
- "What would it take to try this at Dartmouth?"
- "Has anyone worked somewhere that did this? How did it go?"

**Critical Questions** (to challenge ideas)
- "What contexts might this *not* work well in?"
- "What's the counter-argument to this approach?"
- "What problems might this solve? What new problems might it create?"

### Tips for Good Questions

✅ **Do:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Start with easier questions, build to harder ones
- Prepare more questions than you'll need
- Leave room for organic conversation

❌ **Avoid:**
- Yes/no questions
- Questions with obvious "right" answers
- "Did everyone understand X?" (makes people feel tested)
- Too many questions (3-5 is plenty)

## ⏱️ Session Structure (45 minutes)

### Minutes 0-5: Welcome & Setup
**Your script:**
> "Welcome everyone! I'm [Name] and I'll be facilitating today. We're discussing [Topic]. Let me share my screen with our discussion questions..."
>
> [If first-timers present] "Quick format note: This is a discussion, not a presentation. Jump in anytime. No wrong answers."
>
> "Here's our notes doc [share link]. Feel free to add thoughts as we go."

**Quick icebreaker (optional, for first session or small groups):**
> "Let's do a quick round: Name and one thing you hope to get from today's discussion."

### Minutes 5-10: Material Summary
**Keep it brief!** 2-3 minutes maximum.

> "Let me give a quick summary for anyone who didn't get to the full material..."
>
> [2-3 sentence overview of main points]
>
> "The author argues that [main thesis]... They suggest [key recommendation]... Their experience shows [relevant example]."

**Avoid:**
- Restating everything in detail
- Assuming everyone read it
- Going over 3 minutes

### Minutes 10-40: Discussion
This is the heart of the session.

**Getting started:**
> "Let's dive in. First question: [read question from your list]"

**If silence after a question:**
- Count to 7 (seriously, it feels long but works)
- Rephrase the question
- Share your own thought to break ice: "I'll start - when I read this I thought..."
- Call on someone who was nodding: "Sarah, you were nodding - want to share?"

**If conversation flows naturally:**
- Let it go! Don't force your questions
- Take notes on key points
- Jump in only to redirect or go deeper

**If someone dominates:**
- Thank them, then redirect: "Great point. Let's hear from others..."
- Use body language/hand gestures to indicate you're moving on
- Call on quieter folks: "Alex, I'm curious about your perspective..."

**If conversation stalls:**
- Move to next question
- Try: "Has anyone seen something like this in practice?"
- Try: "What's one thing from this we could actually try?"

**If conversation derails:**
- Acknowledge the tangent: "Interesting point about [X]..."
- Redirect: "Let's bookmark that and get back to [original topic]..."
- Use parking lot: "Let's capture that in notes and maybe discuss async"

### Minutes 40-45: Wrap-up
**Synthesize what you heard:**
> "Let me summarize what I heard today..."
> [2-3 key themes or insights from the discussion]

**Action items (if any):**
> "Did we identify anything we want to try or explore further?"

**Next session:**
> "Next month's topic will be [X] or we'll vote between [Y and Z]. Watch for the announcement."

**Thank everyone:**
> "Thanks for the great discussion! Notes will be posted in the repo within a few days. Feel free to continue the conversation in the GitHub thread."

## 💡 Facilitation Tips & Tricks

### Creating Inclusive Discussions

**Balance voices:**
- Notice who hasn't spoken
- Make space: "Let's hear from folks we haven't heard from yet"
- Thank people for speaking up, especially first-timers

**Handle disagreements gracefully:**
- "I hear two different perspectives here - that's valuable"
- "Let's explore both sides..."
- Redirect to ideas, not people: "What are the tradeoffs of approach A vs B?"

**Validate contributions:**
- "That's a great connection to [related concept]"
- "I hadn't thought of it that way"
- "Important point - let me capture that in notes"

### Managing Energy

**If energy is low:**
- Switch formats: "Let's do a quick round-robin"
- Get tactical: "Show of hands: who's tried this?"
- Bring it home: "How would this work on your current project?"
- Take a brief break if needed

**If energy is high:**
- Ride the wave!
- Ensure you're capturing good points
- Watch the time - may need to table some questions

### Technical Tips

**In hybrid settings:**
- Call on remote folks by name
- Repeat in-room comments for remote participants
- Check chat regularly
- Consider co-facilitator to manage tech

**Note-taking:**
- Assign a co-facilitator or volunteer note-taker if possible
- Capture themes, not transcripts
- Note action items and follow-up questions
- It's okay if notes are rough - clean them up later

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Nobody read the material"
- Don't worry! Give a longer summary (5 min)
- Frame questions as hypotheticals: "If you were to implement this..."
- Focus on the concepts, not the specific article

### "I don't understand the material well enough"
- You don't need to! Say: "I'm still wrapping my head around this too. Let's figure it out together."
- Lean on participants: "Can someone explain how they interpreted X?"
- It's okay to say "I don't know - what do others think?"

### "Only 3 people showed up"
- Perfect for deeper discussion!
- Consider shortening to 30 minutes if conversation is thin
- More intimate setting - take advantage

### "15 people showed up"
- Great problem to have!
- Consider breaking into small groups for 10 min, then report back
- Be more directive about calling on people
- May need to table some questions

### "Technical difficulties"
- Have plan B: conference call without video
- Can run session without screen sharing
- Worst case: reschedule and communicate clearly

## ✨ Remember

- **You don't need to be perfect** - we're all learning together
- **Silence is okay** - people need time to think
- **You can't cover everything** - choose depth over breadth
- **Participants want you to succeed** - they're rooting for you
- **It gets easier** - your second session will feel much smoother

The Code Writers Guild succeeds because people like you step up to facilitate. **Thank you!** 🙏
